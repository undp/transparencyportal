A micro assessment is used to manage the risk of transferring cash to partners by assessing their capacity to receive and use the funds for the intended purpose. This course describes UNDP Procedures for micro assessment performed to assess the financial management capacity of partners implementing project activities. This training has been developed for UNDP operations and programme staff and other personnel who work with UNDP in the implementation of development projects that involve cash transfers to partners.</description><keywords /><slidemeta moniker="slide" monikerplural="slides" viewslides="27" slidecountdescription="27 slides" /><author name="11230" email="" website="" /><application name="Articulate Storyline" version="3.15.15581.0" xmlversion="4.0" /></project></meta>
